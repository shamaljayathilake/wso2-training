#       This is the local dictionary file which can be
#       edited by local administrators.  It will be loaded
#       AFTER the main dictionary files are loaded.
#
#       As of version 3.0.2, FreeRADIUS will automatically
#       load the main dictionary files from
#
#               ${prefix}/share/freeradius/dictionary
#
#       It is no longer necessary for this file to $INCLUDE
#       the main dictionaries.  However, if the $INCLUDE
#       line is here, nothing bad will happen.
#
#       Any new/changed attributes MUST be placed in this file.
#       The pre-defined dictionaries SHOULD NOT be edited.
#
#       See "man dictionary" for documentation on its format.

#

#
#       All local attributes and $INCLUDE's should go into
#       this file.
#

#       If you want to add entries to the dictionary file,
#       which are NOT going to be placed in a RADIUS packet,
#       add them to the 'dictionary.local' file.
#
#       The numbers you pick should be between 3000 and 4000.
#       These attributes will NOT go into a RADIUS packet.
#
#       If you want that, you will need to use VSAs.  This means
#       requesting allocation of a Private Enterprise Code from
#       http://iana.org.  We STRONGLY suggest doing that only if
#       you are a vendor of RADIUS equipment.
