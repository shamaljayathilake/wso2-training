#       As of 2.0.0, FreeRADIUS supports virtual hosts using the
#       "server" section, and configuration directives.
#
#       Virtual hosts should be put into the "sites-available"
#       directory.  Soft links should be created in the "sites-enabled"
#       directory to these files.  This is done in a normal installation.
#
#       If you are using 802.1X (EAP) authentication, please see also
#       the "inner-tunnel" virtual server.  You will likely have to edit
#       that, too, for authentication to work.

#       Read "man radiusd" before editing this file.  See the section
#       titled DEBUGGING.  It outlines a method where you can quickly
#       obtain the configuration you want, without running into
#       trouble.  See also "man unlang", which documents the format
#       of this file.
#
#       This configuration is designed to work in the widest possible
#       set of circumstances, with the widest possible number of
#       authentication methods.  This means that in general, you should
#       need to make very few changes to this file.
#
#       The best way to configure the server for your local system
#       is to CAREFULLY edit this file.  Most attempts to make large
#       edits to this file will BREAK THE SERVER.  Any edits should
#       be small, and tested by running the server with "radiusd -X".
#       Once the edits have been verified to work, save a copy of these
#       configuration files somewhere.  (e.g. as a "tar" file).  Then,
#       make more edits, and test, as above.
#
#       There are many "commented out" references to modules such
#       as ldap, sql, etc.  These references serve as place-holders.
#       If you need the functionality of that module, then configure
                                                                                     [ Read 983 lines ]
