#       Configuration file for the rlm_files module.
#       Please see rlm_files(5) manpage for more information.
#
#       This file contains authentication security and configuration
#       information for each user.  Accounting requests are NOT processed
#       through this file.  Instead, see 'accounting', in this directory.
#
#       The first field is the user's name and can be up to
#       253 characters in length.  This is followed (on the same line) with
#       the list of authentication requirements for that user.  This can
#       include password, comm server name, comm server port number, protocol
#       type (perhaps set by the "hints" file), and huntgroup name (set by
#       the "huntgroups" file).
#
#       If you are not sure why a particular reply is being sent by the
#       server, then run the server in debugging mode (radiusd -X), and
#       you will see which entries in this file are matched.
#
#       When an authentication request is received from the comm server,
#       these values are tested. Only the first match is used unless the
#       "Fall-Through" variable is set to "Yes".
#
#       A special user named "DEFAULT" matches on all usernames.
#       You can have several DEFAULT entries. All entries are processed
#       in the order they appear in this file. The first entry that
#       matches the login-request will stop processing unless you use
#       the Fall-Through variable.
#
#       Indented (with the tab character) lines following the first
#       line indicate the configuration values to be passed back to
#       the comm server to allow the initiation of a user session.
#       This can include things like the PPP configuration values
#       or the host to log the user onto.
#
#       You can include another `users' file with `$INCLUDE users.other'
